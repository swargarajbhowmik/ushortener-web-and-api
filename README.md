## URL Shortener Website and API in PHP
This is a PHP-based web application that provides a URL shortening service, allowing users to create shortlinks for long and complex URLs. The application includes a user-friendly web interface as well as a API that can be used to programmatically create short URLs.

### Features
- Simple web interface for creating and managing short URLs
- API for programmatic access to the URL shortening service

### Requirements
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- MySQL database

### Installation and Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.

### Future Plan
This is just a fun project. I'm going to create a 2.0 for this repo, adding more functionality in future.
